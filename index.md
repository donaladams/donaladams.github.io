My name is DÃ³nal. I'm a software developer, bread baker and general dabbler based in Dublin, Ireland. I studied music for my undergrad, then moved to computer science, ending up with an MSc in Computing with a specialism in AI from Imperial College London.

I've worked for Apple as a software engineer on Maps, Caffeinehit Ltd as the lead backend developer for the app [Pin Drop](http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/26/pin-drop-app-launches-on-us-app-store-with-smart-new-features/) and Paddy Power Plc as a quants developer. I was also part of the Dublin Design Collective with whom I took part in the city-wide, interactive exhibitions [Helsinki Tagged!](http://www.roji.ie/Helsinki-Tagged) and [Dublin Tagged!](http://www.roji.ie/Dublin-Tagged). I have primarily focussed on server-side and web development but I love trying out new things.

I like to use Python, Scala, Java and the usual web technologies but again, I love trying out new things.
