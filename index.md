{% include breadshot.html %}

My name is DÃ³nal. I'm a software developer, bread baker and general dabbler. I studied music for my undergrad, then moved to computer science, ending up with an MSc in Computing with a specialism in AI from Imperial College London.

I'm currently based in London, UK and work for Apple Inc.

I've worked for Paddy Power Plc as a quants developer, Caffeinehit Ltd as the lead backend developer for the app Pin Drop and most recently as a software engineer on Apple Maps. I was also part of the Dublin Design Collective with whom I took part in the city-wide, interactive exhibitions "Helsinki Tagged!" and "Dublin Tagged!". I have primarily focussed on server-side and web development but I love trying out new things.

I like to use Python, Scala, Java and the usual web technologies but again, I love trying out new things.
