My name is DÃ³nal. I'm a software developer, bread baker and general dabbler based in Dublin, Ireland. I studied music for my undergrad, then moved to computer science, ending up with an MSc in Computing with a specialism in AI from Imperial College London.

I'm particularly interested in the role of software in the Circular Economy.

I have worked as Engineering Team Lead at [FoodCloud](https://food.cloud/), Senior Platform Engineer and Team lead at [Nitro](https://www.gonitro.com/), for Apple as a software engineer on Maps, for Caffeinehit Ltd as the lead backend developer for the [Pin Drop](http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/26/pin-drop-app-launches-on-us-app-store-with-smart-new-features/) and for Paddy Power Plc as a quants developer. I was also part of the Dublin Design Collective with whom I took part in the city-wide, interactive exhibitions [Helsinki Tagged!](http://www.roji.ie/Helsinki-Tagged) and [Dublin Tagged!](http://www.roji.ie/Dublin-Tagged).
